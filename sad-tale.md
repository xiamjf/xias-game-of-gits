House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.
Just kidding. He died.
But his children and wife survived. His youngest daughter Arya became no one.
And some stuff happened with Jon Snow too. To be honest, I quit watching after
a few seasons, so I'm not really up to date. I'm sure it was appropriately epic.
